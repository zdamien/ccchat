# cchat
C++ chat a la occhat.  And simpler programs to test the C++
infrastructure I'm building up.

syn_queue: synchronized queue class
tSQ: test

unique_fd: file descriptor handle
testfh: guess

exc_socket: exception wrappers to several POSIX functions

hello_sock: minimal 'hello' server

echo_*: echo server and client

ccchat*: chat files

readline.cc, readn, writen: mostly taken from UNP

Work in progress.
